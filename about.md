I'm Mikko, Clojure(Script) developer from Helsinki, Finland.

I'm working for a company called [Sharetribe](https://www.sharetribe.com). We're building marketplace software using Clojure, ClojureScript and Datomic.

This blog is a place for my notes about learning Clojure(Script) and documenting related ideas and proof-of-concepts.

You can find the [source code for the blog at Github](https://github.com/rap1ds/rap1ds.github.io). If you find an error, typo or mistake from the blog, you can file an [Issue at Github](https://github.com/rap1ds/rap1ds.github.io/issues).

All feedback is appreciated!
